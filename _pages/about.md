Hi! My name is Xianghan Cui (å´”ç¿”ç¿°), welcome to my research homepage. 

I'm a second-year PhD student in astrophysics at National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([NAOC](http://english.nao.cas.cn)), advised by [Di Li](http://groups.bao.ac.cn/ism/english/chiefscientist/202204/t20220415_695884.html) and [Chengmin Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~zhangcm?language=en). My main research interests are in fast radio bursts (FRB) and pulsars, but I'm curious about everything in the universe.
